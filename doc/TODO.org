* DONE learn neural supersampling for real-time rendering

* DONE learn High-Quality Supersampling via Mask-reinforced Deep Learning for Real-time Rendering


* DONE study neural supersampling for real-time rendering 


* DONE learn code


* DONE run code

** DONE run train 1 epoch, small samples

problem:
- loss error

1.set preTrained=false
2.download vgg16
3.load model


- output is empty
value is target * 1/10

should print in 1,2 epoch and compare the whether output value increase!?


** DONE run test



* TODO learn detail


* TODO implement inference by webnn
