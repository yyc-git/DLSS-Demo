* DONE learn neural supersampling for real-time rendering

* DONE learn High-Quality Supersampling via Mask-reinforced Deep Learning for Real-time Rendering


* DONE study neural supersampling for real-time rendering 


* DONE learn code


* DONE run code

** DONE run train 1 epoch, small samples

problem:
- loss error

1.set preTrained=false
2.download vgg16
3.load model


- output is empty
value is target * 1/10

should print in 1,2 epoch and compare the whether output value increase!?


** DONE run test



* DONE learn detail

why need frames?
ans: for temporal stable 


# can need previous frames?


how can wspn do frame accu?reprojection?
yes



# * TODO implement type

TODO define MLGraphBuilder
use dependent type!


* TODO implement inference by webnn




* TODO implement path tracer by webgpu + lbvh

code in Wonder.js->master branch



* TODO implement wspk denoiser with path tracer

generate input(.png) for train and inference

    motion vector .png should preprocess data:
    1./ 10
    2.to [0,1]  

* TODO implement NSRR DLSS with path tracer

generate input(.png) for train and inference

    motion vector .png should preprocess data:
    1./ 10
    2.to [0,1]  



# ** TODO change Motion input to accu current frame ClipPosition input

#   vCurrentFrameClipPosition = getLastViewProjectionMatrix() * uModel.lastModelMatrix *
#                       vec4(position, 1.0);

# so utils.py-> backward_warp_motion->current_frame_grid/vgrid now = motion directly! 


still use motion vector!


** TODO train and inference should add backward warp step!

add backward warp step:

        all_motionVector_upsampled = all_flow_upsampled

        list_previous_features_warped = []
        for i in range(0, self.number_previous_frames):
            accu_previous_feature_warped  = all_features_upsampled[:,:,i + 1,:,:]

            for j in range(0, i):
                accu_previous_feature_warped = self.motion_warping_function(
                    accu_previous_feature_warped,
                    all_motionVector_upsampled[:,:,i - j,:,:]
                )

            list_previous_features_warped.append(accu_previous_feature_warped)


def backward_warp_motion(img: torch.Tensor, motion: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    suppose img_grid = (img_grid_x(range: [0,1]), img_grid_y(range: [0,1])) in img, motion = (current_frame_grid_x - last_frame_grid_x, current_frame_grid_y - last_frame_grid_y) 

    # 1.current_frame_grid = grid + motion
    # ////2.wrap_img = current_frame_img
    # 2.wrap_img = img
    # 3.if(current_frame_grid in size)  wrap_img[current_frame_grid] = bilinear(img[grid])

    1.last_frame_grid = (img_grid_x, img_grid_y) - motion[img_grid_x, img_grid_y] 
    2.wrap_img = img
    3.if(last_frame_grid in size)  wrap_img[img_grid_x, img_grid_y] = bilinear(img[last_frame_grid])



* TODO publish Wonder.js v3.0.0-alpha.1 version
